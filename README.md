# JPA to CDI Events

This project will convert JPA events (create, update, remove) to CDI.

A typical use case would be if you wanted to received a notification whenever an entity has been modified
and do some processing afterwards like triggering a script.

## Execution

To run this application simply deploy it on a Wildfly server and check the logs.

See our example for Spring https://github.com/czetsuya/jpa-to-spring-events
